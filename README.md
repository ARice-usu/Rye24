Team Info:   
Hi guys, here is just a few things to keep in mind when using github and working on the project.   

I created a 'branch' called "development". This branch just means we won't be working directly on the 'main' branch. This allows expirimentation and extra work while not comprimising previously done work. Branches also help us work on different elements at the same time, although this can get more complicated when using Unity. 

You can download the repo files the same way you would have when wokring on the tutorials. 

Merging to main or making changes in the main branch is protected so someone else has to approve it. This is just so nothing happens accidentally. This protection currently isn't on any other branch.
